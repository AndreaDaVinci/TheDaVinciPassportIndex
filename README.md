### Welcome to The Da Vinci Passport Index

The Da Vinci Passport Index is a ranking of the world's passports, using a comprehensive formula that avoids oversimplifying.
For more details, check the <a href="https://medium.com/@AndreaDaVinci/the-da-vinci-passport-index-c3e574c15adb">article on Medium</a>.

# Ingredients

The formula includes:

- Data about the number of destinations accessible to the passport holders, with a distinction between the three access levels: Visa free, visa on arrival and eTA required.
- The destination’s HDI (Human Development Index) by the United Nations Development Program, to reflect the destination’s level of development.
- The destination’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) to reflect the strategic importance of the destination.
- The destination’s area to reflect the size of the destination.
- The destination’s TTCI (Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index) by the World Economic Forum, to reflect the tourism attractiveness of the destination.

# The formula

### Destinations:

The score of a destination is equal to the weighted average of the four scores:

- HDI (Human Development Index) = percentage of the highest value.
- GDP (Gross Domestic Product) = percentage of the world’s highest GDP.
- Destination’s area = percentage of the world’s biggest area.
- TTCI (Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index) = percentage of the highest value.

Weight factors:

- HDI (Human Development Index): Weight = 5
- GDP (Gross Domestic Product):	Weight = 1
- Destination’s area:	Weight = 1
- TTCI (Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index): Weight = 5

### Passports:

The total score of a passport is equal to the total of all its accessible destinations’ values. And to reflect the difference between the different access levels, an adjustment factor is used:

- Access level 1 [Visa free]: Adjustment factor = 1
- Access level 2 [Visa on arrival]: Adjustment factor = 0.9
- Access level 3 [eTA required]: Adjustment factor = 0.8
